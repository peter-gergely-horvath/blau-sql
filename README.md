# BlauSQL: Text-Mode JDBC Database Client

BlauSQL is a lightweight, menu-driven database client for terminal environments. 
It connects to any JDBC-compatible database and runs on any system with Java installed.

## Features

- **Universal Database Support**: Works with any database that has a JDBC driver
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Linux, Windows, macOS, and Unix systems
- **Menu-Driven Interface**: No need to memorize command syntax
- **Connection Management**: Save connection configurations for quick access
- **SSH-Optimized**: Designed for remote work on Linux/Unix servers via SSH

## Why BlauSQL?

Traditional terminal database tools require memorizing database-specific commands 
and syntax. BlauSQL provides a universal, menu-driven interface that works 
consistently across all JDBC-compatible databases - typically getting you connected 
and querying in just two keystrokes with saved connections. 

Particularly useful when working remotely on Linux/Unix servers through SSH sessions, 
where GUI clients aren't available or practical.

Perfect for:
- Quick queries during SSH sessions on remote servers
- Database administration on Linux/Unix systems
- Development and testing in terminal environments
- When GUI clients are too heavy or unavailable

## Requirements

- Java 11 or higher
- JDBC drivers for your databases
- Terminal access
